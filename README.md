## 📖 Help: MiniStatus Dashboard Feature Documentation

### 1. Static GitHub Repos Panel
Display a list of favorite or important GitHub repositories on your dashboard.
- In `app/routes/public.py`, add your repos to the `github_repos` list.
- This list is passed to the template and rendered as a panel on the homepage.
- To add more repos, just add more dictionaries to the `github_repos` list.

### 2. Using YAML Files for Configuration
MiniStatus supports YAML files for configuration of certain features, making it easy to manage and version-control your dashboard settings.

> **All YAML config files should now be placed in the `config/` directory in your project root.**
> For example: `MiniStatus-MVP/config/auto_tag_rules.yaml`, `MiniStatus-MVP/config/quick_links.yaml`, etc.

#### a. Auto-Tag Rules (`auto_tag_rules.yaml`)
- **Purpose:** Automatically assign tags to services based on rules.
- **Location:** Place your YAML file at the root of your project or mount it in Docker as `/app/auto_tag_rules.yaml`.
- **Example format:**
  ```yaml
  rules:
    - match: "docker"
      tags: ["docker", "container"]
    - match: "nginx"
      tags: ["web", "reverse-proxy"]
    - match: "postgres"
      tags: ["database", "sql"]
  ```
- **How it works:** When a service name matches the `match` string, the listed tags are applied. You can manage these rules from the Admin UI at `/admin/auto-tag-rules` or by editing the YAML file directly.
- **Reference:** See [MiniStatus-MVP GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LieAndSmile/MiniStatus-MVP) for more details.

#### b. Services List (`services.yaml`)
- **Purpose:** Define and manage the list of services to be monitored.
- **Example format:**
  ```yaml
  services:
    - name: nginx
      description: "Web server"
      tags: ["web", "reverse-proxy"]
      url: "http://localhost"
      status: "up"
    - name: postgres
      description: "Database server"
      tags: ["database", "sql"]
      url: "localhost:5432"
      status: "down"
  ```
- **How it works:** Each service entry defines its name, description, tags, URL, and status. You can import or sync services from this file via the Admin UI or CLI.

#### c. Quick Links (`quick_links.yaml`)
- **Purpose:** Add custom quick links to the dashboard for easy access to tools and resources.
- **Example format:**
  ```yaml
  links:
    - name: Grafana
      url: "http://grafana.local"
      category: "Monitoring"
      icon_url: "/static/icons/grafana.svg"
    - name: GitLab
      url: "http://gitlab.local"
      category: "DevOps"
      icon_url: "/static/icons/gitlab.svg"
  ```
- **How it works:** Each link appears in the Quick Links panel, grouped by category.

### 3. How to Use These YAML Files
- Mount or place the YAML files in your project root or the appropriate config directory.
- For Docker: Mount them as volumes, e.g.:
  ```bash
  -v $(pwd)/auto_tag_rules.yaml:/app/auto_tag_rules.yaml:ro
  -v $(pwd)/services.yaml:/app/services.yaml:ro
  -v $(pwd)/quick_links.yaml:/app/quick_links.yaml:ro
  ```
- Edit and reload: Changes to YAML files are picked up automatically (or via a reload in the Admin UI).

Place all your YAML config files in the `config/` directory. For Docker, mount the entire config directory:
```bash
-v $(pwd)/config:/app/config:ro
```
Edit and reload: Changes to YAML files are picked up automatically (or via a reload in the Admin UI).

## 🏷️ Auto-Tag Rules (v1.1.0+)

You can customize how tags are automatically assigned to services:

- **YAML/JSON Config:**
  - Mount a config file (see above) for advanced or version-controlled rules.
  - Edit and reload as needed.
- **Admin UI:**
  - Manage auto-tag rules from the web dashboard at `/admin/auto-tag-rules`.
  - No restart required; changes take effect immediately.

If both are present, the config file takes precedence. Remove or rename it to use the UI/database rules only.
